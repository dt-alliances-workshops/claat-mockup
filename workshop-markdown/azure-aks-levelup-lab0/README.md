# Azure AKS Levelup Workshop Lab 0 - Setup

## Learning Objectives

We will now setup Dynatrace, Azure, and the workshop environment. You need all of these in place before you are presented with the lab excercises.

### What you'll learn in this section
Duration: 1

üî∑ Setup your Azure Native Dynatrace Service environment via Marketplace.

üî∑ Automatically provision workshop environment and sample application

<!--
## Azure Pass Subscription Setup
Duration: 4

To complete this workshop, you will be provided an Azure Pass Promo code.  A workshop staff will provide that code to prior or during the day of the workshop.

That Azure Pass Promo code enables you to have a separate Azure subscription setup under a separate account to provision all the resources needed to complete the workshop.     

This free Azure subscription will be available to you for the next 5 days or until when the $100 credit is utilized by the Azure resources (whichever comes first).


### Tasks to complete this step

1. To setup your workshop using free Azure Pass subscription, navigate to <a href="https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft's Azure Pass website</a>

5. To verify which subscription is configured for the Azure CLI, run this command.
    ```console
      az account show
    ```

- Look for the name in the output. This is example when a promo code was used.

    ```
      {
        "environmentName": "AzureCloud",
        "homeTenantId": "xxx-xxx-xxx-xx-xxx",
        "id": "yyy-yyyy-yyy-yyy-yyy",
        "isDefault": true,
        "managedByTenants": [], 
        "name": "Azure Pass - Sponsorship",   <----- This is the active subscription
        "state": "Enabled",
        "tenantId": "zzz-zzz-zzz-zzz-zzz",
        "user": {
          "name": "name@company.com",
          "type": "user"
        }
      }
    ```

    <aside class="positive"> üíª If the subscription is not `Azure Pass - Sponsorship`, run the command below to see all the subscriptions for your user id. If this is the first time using Azure portal or a trial, then you should only have one subscription. </aside>

    ```
    az account list --output table
    ```

- Here is an sample output:

    ```
      Name                                     CloudName    SubscriptionId                        State    IsDefault
      ---------------------------------------  -----------  ------------------------------------  -------  -----------
      Subscription 1                           AzureCloud   aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa  Enabled  False

      Azure Pass - Sponsorship                 AzureCloud   eeeeeeee-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa  Enabled  True
    ```

- If the `Azure Pass - Sponsorship` is not the `IsDefault = True`, then run these command to set and verify.

    ```
      # set the subscription
      az account set --subscription <YOUR PROMO SUBSCRIPTION ID>

      # verify change
      az account list --output table

      # double check with
      az account show
    ```

    Please copy this value to a local TEXT file before you leave this page. (For example Notepad, Notepad++, Notes.app)
    </aside>

    


## Collect Inputs for Provision Script
Duration: 2

The next step will have you gather various information from your Dynatrace environment thats needed to configure your environment and for the lab exercises.

<aside class="positive"> 
  üìì The next set of steps assume that your Dynatrace tenant is fully provisioned from previous step and you are logged into it.
</aside>

From your Dynatrace environment, you will capture:

* Dynatrace Base URL
* Dynatrace API token

<aside class="positive"> 

- The **Base URL** will be in the Dynatrace tenant URL such as: https://[ENVIRONMENT ID].apps.dynatrace.com/.
- The **Access API Token** will the token generated in the previous step when you setup your Dynatrace envrionment.
- The **Azure Subscription** ID will be Azure Portal -> Search for subscriptions at the top and select the `Azure Pass` subscription.

</aside>

### Capture Inputs Script

In the code repo you cloned, there is a simple UNIX shell script that prompts for values and writes them to a file called `gen/workshop-credentials.json`. Later in the labs, there are a few other simple UNIX shell scripts that will automate the step that reads this file so that you don‚Äôt need to type or copy-paste these values over and over again during the workshop.


### Lets begin..

1. Run the input credentials Unix script

  ```
  cd ~/azure-modernization-dt-orders-setup/provision-scripts
  ./input-credentials.sh
  ```
1. Enter in the approprite values for the three inputs
    ```
      ==================================================================
      Please enter your Dynatrace credentials as requested below: 
      Press <enter> to keep the current value
      ===================================================================
      Dynatrace Base URL              (current: ) : 
      Dynatrace Access API Token      (current: ) : 
      Azure Subscription ID           (current: ) : 
      ===================================================================
    ```

    <aside class="positive"> 
    üìì If you mess up, just click [enter] to run through the rest of the values and save it at the ending prompt.  You can then just re-run the script and the script will prompt to re-enter each value showing you each current value that it saved.  Just update the value that needs to be changed.
    </aside>

1. Confirm all of the inputs are correct 
    <aside class="positive"> 
     üìì There are some derived values the script generated based on your input.  
    </aside>
1. Once you confirm, the data is saved off `../gen/workshop-credentials.json` and will be used by the provision script in the next step.
1. Towards the end of the script it will output two things you'll want to save in a notepad session to use in Lab2 later.
    ```
      ========================================================================================================
      ***** Please save the values below in a notepad for Lab2 when we install the Dynatrace Operator on AKS Cluster ***** 
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Dynatrace Operator & Data Ingest Token  :       dt0c01.ABC123.ABC124
      API URL for Dynatrace Tenant            :       https://dtenvid.live.dynatrace.com/api
      =========================================================================================================
    ```


## Provision the workshop
Duration: 15

This step will automatically provision several Azure resources and Dynatrace configuration needed for the workshop via a shell script.  

The process to provision everything will take ~15-20 minutes.

### What exactly is this script doing?

1 . Add Azure resources

- Add a Resource Group for all the VMs named: `dynatrace-azure-grail-modernize`
<!--
- Add Service Principal: `dynatrace-azure-modernize-workshop-sp` needed for the Azure monitor integration.
- Add VM named: `dt-orders-active-gate`. At startup, it installs the Dynatrace ActiveGate process needed for the Azure monitor integration.
-->
- Add VM named: `dt-orders-monolith`. At startup, it installs Docker and the Dynatrace Orders application in the Monolith configuration. OneAgent is installed using Azure extension
- Add Azure Kubernetes Cluster named `dynatrace-azure-grail-cluster`.

2 . Set Dynatrace configuration

- Set global [Frequent Issue Detection](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/problem-detection-and-analysis/problem-detection/detection-of-frequent-issues/) settings to Off
- Adjust the [Service Anomaly Detection](https://dynatrace.com/support/help/platform/davis-ai/anomaly-detection/adjust-sensitivity-anomaly-detection/adjust-sensitivity-services/) global settings to a fixed error threshold
- Add [Management Zones](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/management-zones/) for the monolith and micro services versions of the application
- Add [Auto Tagging Rules](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/tags-and-metadata/) to drive management zone and SLO settings
- Add [SLOs](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/service-level-objectives/) for a use in custom dashboards
- Add [Azure Monitor Integration](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-cloud-platforms/microsoft-azure-services/azure-integrations/azure-cloud-services-metrics/monitor-azure-integration-service-environment)

<aside class="positive"> 

  üììThe Dynatrace configuration scripts use a combination of [Dynatrace Monitoring as Code](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-monitoring-as-code) framework (a.k.a. monaco) and the [Dynatrace Configuration API](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/configuration-api/) for those few Dynatrace configurations not yet supported by monaco.

</aside>

### Tasks to complete this step
1. Open up Azure Cloud shell open

1. Copy the command from below and hit enter it into your Azure Cloud shell and hit enter.  
    ```
      ./provision-workshop.sh grail
    ```

1. You should see a prompt similar to as one below.

    ```
      ===================================================================
      About to setup Dynatrace Grail Workshop
      Dynatrace Server: https://name.live.dynatrace.com
      SETUP_TYPE   = grail
      ===================================================================
      Proceed? (y/n) : 
    ```
9. Enter **y** at the prompt to begin the provisioning of the workshop.  Once the script is complete you should see output as shown below
    ```
      =============================================
      Provisioning workshop resources COMPLETE
      End: Thu 25 Nov 2021 12:45:29 PM UTC
      =============================================
    ```

## Validate workshop provisioning completed
Duration: 2
In this step we will verify if all of the Azure resources were provisioned for the workshop

<aside class="positive"> 

üìì Only proceed if the provisioning script completed with this status

  ```
  ...
  ...
  =============================================
  Provisioning workshop resources COMPLETE
  =============================================
  ```

</aside>

### Tasks to complete this step
1. Go back to the window where you have the Azure Portal screen open
2. Search for `Resource Groups` from the search bar at the top
![image](img/pre-requisites-azure-portal-resources.png)
3. Click on `Resource Groups`.  From the list of resource group select `dynatrace-azure-grail-modernize`.
4. Once you're within the resource group, you will see all of the different types of resources we've automatically provisioned for this workshop
![image](img/pre-requisites-azure-portal-resources-resourcelist.png)

### Verify AKS Cluster is provisioned
- In this step we will verify if the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster was provisioned correctly. Also we will download the credentials to manage our AKS cluster via `kubectl` commands.

- The <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/" target="_blank">kubectl</a> command line tool that lets you control Kubernetes clusters.  For details about each command, including all the supported flags and subcommands, see the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/" target="_blank">kubectl</a> reference documentation.

1. Run this command in Azure Cloud shell to get familiar with the command line options for kubectl.

    ```
    kubectl --help
    ```

1. Configure kubectl to connect to the new cluster by downloading the cluster credentials. 

    ```
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group dynatrace-azure-grail-modernize --name dynatrace-azure-grail-cluster    
    ```
1. Verify you are connected.  You should see `dynatrace-azure-grail-cluster` as the output.

    ```
    kubectl config current-context
    ```

1. List the nodes in the cluster

    ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    The output should look like this:

    ```
    NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE   VERSION
    aks-nodepool1-74092643-vmss000000   Ready    agent   21h   v1.19.11
    aks-nodepool1-74092643-vmss000001   Ready    agent   21h   v1.19.11
    ```

    You can see even more detail with this command.

    ```
    kubectl describe nodes
    ```

    <aside class="positive"> 

    üìì Ensure you're able to sucessfully run all of the `kubectl` commands above.  This ensures you can sucessfully connectivity to the AKS cluster, which is key in Lab2 when we deploy the sample application to the AKS cluster in Lab2, Step 5

    </aside>

### Optional Verification of AKS Cluster via Azure Portal

- Within the Azure web portal, search for the kubernetes services and then click on the new workshop cluster.

![image](img/setup-k8.png)

- Explore the configuration to view the number of nodes and the kubernetes version.

![image](img/setup-k8-node.png)
