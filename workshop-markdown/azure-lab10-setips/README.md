## Notes & Tips and Tricks

* During day of the workshop we will use Azure Pass subscription codes so that each customer has their own Azure Tenant with all the privileges
    * **We will have some extra subscription pass codes to give to the SE's to try out the workshop.**
* Each Azure Paas subscription will expire after 5 days or until the $100 credit is utilized by Azure Resources **(whichever comes first)**
* Prior to the workshop delivery date.  Walk through each exercise in the labs 0-4.  If you find any caveats, have questions or parts do not work please provide feedback.
* During the day of the workshop
    * Demonstrate each of the exercises in the labs.  
    * Have multiple tabs open in your browser
        * [Lab Content](https://learn.alliances.dynatracelabs.com/azure?cat=kubernetes)
        * PPT Content - Customized for the event
        * [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
