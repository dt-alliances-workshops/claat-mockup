If you are unable to login or did not get your tenant invitation email, first ensure you used the newly created gmail address as required and check spam and junk folders.  


## Creating a Dynatrace All In One Token

     `this would not typically be best practice but for this workshop we will break a few rules.`
    3.	Click on `Generate token`

## Provision Script Command

Your instructors have simplyfied a few pieces of the workshop in order to streamline the AWS deployments.  In this step you will be composing your provisioning command that we will cut and paste into the AWS CLI during the workshop.

```
cd ~/aws-modernization-dt-orders-setup/provision-scripts && ./provision-workshop.sh {tenant URL} {Dynatrace token} {Tenant Email}
```
1.  Copy the above command to a notepad
2.	Replace {Tenant URL} with your tenant URL:  https://xxxxxxx.live.dynatrace.com
3.	From the all in one token you created and replace {Dynatrace token}:  dt0c01.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4.	Finally replace {Tenant Email}: with the email you used to create the tenant. 
5.	Once the command has been edited and saved it should look like:
