    ```

- Look for the name in the output. This is example when a promo code was used.

    ```
      {
        "environmentName": "AzureCloud",
        "homeTenantId": "xxx-xxx-xxx-xx-xxx",
        "id": "yyy-yyyy-yyy-yyy-yyy",
        "isDefault": true,
        "managedByTenants": [], 
        "name": "Azure Pass - Sponsorship",   <----- This is the active subscription
        "state": "Enabled",
        "tenantId": "zzz-zzz-zzz-zzz-zzz",
        "user": {
          "name": "name@company.com",
          "type": "user"
        }
      }
    ```

    <aside class="positive"> üíª If the subscription is not `Azure Pass - Sponsorship`, run the command below to see all the subscriptions for your user id. If this is the first time using Azure portal or a trial, then you should only have one subscription. </aside>

    ```
    az account list --output table
    ```

- Here is an sample output:

    ```
      Name                                     CloudName    SubscriptionId                        State    IsDefault
      ---------------------------------------  -----------  ------------------------------------  -------  -----------
      Subscription 1                           AzureCloud   aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa  Enabled  False
      Subscription 2                           AzureCloud   bbbbbbbb-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa  Enabled  False
      Subscription 3                           AzureCloud   cccccccc-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa  Enabled  False
      Subscription 4                           AzureCloud   dddddddd-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa  Enabled  False
      Azure Pass - Sponsorship                 AzureCloud   eeeeeeee-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa  Enabled  True
    ```

- If the `Azure Pass - Sponsorship` is not the `IsDefault = True`, then run these command to set and verify.

    ```
      # set the subscription
      az account set --subscription <YOUR PROMO SUBSCRIPTION ID>

      # verify change
      az account list --output table

      # double check with
      az account show
    ```

6. Within your Azure Cloud Shell window, run this command to download the workshop scripts:
    ```
      git clone https://github.com/dt-alliances-workshops/azure-modernization-dt-orders-setup.git
    ```
7. To validate all the workshops scripts have download, please run these commands within the Azure Cloud Shell window to display the directories

## Provision the workshop
Duration: 15

This step will automatically provision several Azure resources and Dynatrace configuration needed for the workshop via a shell script.  

The process to provision everything will take ~15-20 minutes.

### What exactly is this script doing?

1 . Add Azure resources

- Add a Resource Group for all the VMs named: `dynatrace-azure-modernize-workshop`
- Add Service Principal: `dynatrace-azure-modernize-workshop-sp` needed for the Azure monitor integration.
- Add VM named: `dt-orders-monolith`. At startup, it installs Docker and the Dynatrace Orders application in the Monolith configuration. OneAgent is installed using Azure extension
- Add VM named: `dt-orders-active-gate`. At startup, it installs the Dynatrace ActiveGate process needed for the Azure monitor integration.
- Add Azure Kubernetes Cluster named `dynatrace-workshop-cluster`.

2 . Set Dynatrace configuration

- Set global [Frequent Issue Detection](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/problem-detection-and-analysis/problem-detection/detection-of-frequent-issues/) settings to Off
- Adjust the [Service Anomaly Detection](https://dynatrace.com/support/help/platform/davis-ai/anomaly-detection/adjust-sensitivity-anomaly-detection/adjust-sensitivity-services/) global settings to a fixed error threshold
- Add [Management Zones](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/management-zones/) for the monolith and micro services versions of the application
- Add [Auto Tagging Rules](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/tags-and-metadata/) to drive management zone and SLO settings
- Add [SLOs](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/service-level-objectives/) for a use in custom dashboards
- Add [Azure Monitor Integration](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-cloud-platforms/microsoft-azure-services/azure-integrations/azure-cloud-services-metrics/monitor-azure-integration-service-environment)

### üí• **TECHNICAL NOTE**

_The Dynatrace configuration scripts use a combination of [Dynatrace Monitoring as Code](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-monitoring-as-code) framework (a.k.a. monaco) and the [Dynatrace Configuration API](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/configuration-api/) for those few Dynatrace configurations not yet supported by monaco._

### Tasks to complete this step
1. Login to the Dynatrace UI
2. From left side in Dynatrace, pick the dashboard menu
3. On the Dashboard page, open the Workshop Provisioning dashboard.
![image](img/dt-provision-dashboard-list.png)
4. While inside the Workshop Provisioning dashboard page, click on edit
![image](img/dt-provision-dashboard-edit.png)
5. Select the tile that has provisioning command
![image](img/dt-copy-command.png)
6. Copy ALL the text from the Markdown text on the right. You will paste this in the Azure cloud shell as the next step.

7. Return back to the window where you have the Azure Cloud shell open
8. Paste the full command and hit enter.  You should see a prompt similar to as one below.

    ```
      ===================================================================
      About to Provision Workshop for
      Dynatrace Managed Server: https://name.dynatrace-managed.com/e/aaaaa-bbbb-ccccc-ddddd
      SETUP_TYPE   = all
      ===================================================================
      Proceed? (y/n) : 
    ```
9. Enter **y** at the prompt to begin the provisioning of the workshop.  Once the script is complete you should see output as shown below
    ```
      =============================================
      Provisioning workshop resources COMPLETE
      End: Thu 25 Nov 2021 12:45:29 PM UTC
      =============================================
    ```

## Validate workshop provisioning completed
Duration: 2
In this step we will verify if all of the Azure resources were provisioned for the workshop

### üí•NOTE:Only proceed if the provisioning script completed with this status:

```
...
...
=============================================
Provisioning workshop resources COMPLETE
=============================================
```

### Tasks to complete this step
1. Go back to the window where you have the Azure Portal screen open
2. Search for `Resource Groups` from the search bar at the top
![image](img/pre-requisites-azure-portal-resources.png)
3. Click on `Resource Groups`.  From the list of resource group select `dynatrace-azure-modernize-workshop`.
4. Once you within the resource group, you will see all of the different types of resources we've automatically provisionined for this workshop
![image](img/pre-requisites-azure-portal-resources-resourcelist.png)

### Verify AKS Cluster is provisioned
- In this step we will verify if the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster was provisioned correctly. Also we will download the credentials to manage our AKS cluster via `kubectl` commands.

- The <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/" target="_blank">kubectl</a> command line tool that lets you control Kubernetes clusters.  For details about each command, including all the supported flags and subcommands, see the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/" target="_blank">kubectl</a> reference documentation.

1. Run this command in Azure Cloud shell to get familiar with the command line options for kubectl.

    ```
    kubectl --help
    ```

1. Configure kubectl to connect to the new cluster by downloading the cluster credentials. 

    ```
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group dynatrace-azure-modernize-workshop --name dynatrace-workshop-cluster
    ```

1. Verify you are connected.  You should see `dynatrace-workshop-cluster` as the output.

    ```
    kubectl config current-context
    ```

1. List the nodes in the cluster

    ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    The output should look like this:

    ```
    NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE   VERSION
    aks-nodepool1-74092643-vmss000000   Ready    agent   21h   v1.19.11
    aks-nodepool1-74092643-vmss000001   Ready    agent   21h   v1.19.11
    ```

    You can see even more detail with this command.

    ```
    kubectl describe nodes
    ```

### Optional Verification of AKS Cluster via Azure Portal

- Within the Azure web portal, search for the kubernetes services and then click on the new workshop cluster.
