# Azure Grail Workshop Lab 3 - Azure Monitor

## Objectives of this Lab 
Duration: 3

In order to do more with less and scale, organizations must transcend IT silos, foster collaboration and improve productivity. Automation and a common data model are key components of this, but it takes platforms that support operational teams and workflows.

With [Azure Native Dynatrace Services](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/using-dynatrace-on-microsoft-azure/), our SaaS solution is available as a native azure resource in the Azure Portal.  With the native azure resource, we can easily get Azure monitor metrics and azure resource logs without the need of provisioning ActiveGate in your Azure subscription to query the Azure Monitor metrics or setting up Eventhub or Azure functions to forward Azure logs.  

üî∑ Review how Azure Native Dynatrace integrates and gathers [Azure monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/monitor/) metrics

üî∑ Review how Azure monitor metrics can be configured as [Metric events for alerts](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/problem-detection-and-analysis/problem-detection/metric-events-for-alerting/)

## Review - Azure Monitor Setup
Duration: 3

Referring to the picture below, here are the components for this lab.

<!-- ![image](img/lab4-setup.png) -->
![image](img/lab3-ands-metrics.png)

**#1 . Azure**:  Azure cloud platform where Azure services produce metrics that are sent to Azure monitor.

**#2 . Azure Native Dynatrace Service**: An <a href="https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-cloud-platforms/microsoft-azure-services/azure-platform/azure-native-integration" target="_blank"> native Azure resource </a> inside the Azure Portal. 

**#3 . Dynatrace Azure Dashboard**: Out of the box dashboard for each configured Azure subscription.

### Azure Dashboard

In addition to monitoring your Azure workloads using OneAgent, Dynatrace provides integration with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview" target="_blank"> Azure Monitor </a> which adds infrastructure monitoring to gain insight even into serverless application scenarios.

The integration uses Azure Monitor metrics for service insights, as well as Azure Resource Manager (ARM) to gather metadata.

### Review your environment

1. From the left side menu in Dynatrace, click the `Azure` menu item.
1. Scroll down, and in the `Environment dynamics` action click on the `eastus` region to open the virtual machine regional page  

### Virtual machine regional page 

Notice the following details:
1. A summary of type and status is shown
1. A running average for virtual machines
1. A table of host with Azure monitor metrics summarized.  Notice that both VMs with and without an OneAgent are both shown

![image](img/lab4-host-list.png)

### Virtual machine details 

Click on the `dt-orders-active-gate` host to open the host page.

Notice the following details:
1. Expand the properties to see more details
1. All the Azure monitor metrics are viewable as time-series data

**üëç How this helps**

Dynatrace brings value by enriching the data from Azure Monitor/App Insights and extending observability into the platform with additional metrics for cloud infrastructure, load balancers, API Management Services, and more.‚Äã

These metrics are managed by Dynatrace's AI engine automatically and this extended observability improves operations, reduces MTTR and increases innovation.

## Cloud App Review
Duration: 5

The Dynatrace Clouds app, a novel way for observing multiple resources across multiple clouds. It provides a single, centralized dashboard that displays all resources across multiple clouds, and significantly enhances multicloud resource tracking and governance.

The [Clouds App]([https://www.dynatrace.com/hub/detail/clouds/?query=clouds&filter=all) provides:
    - Centralized oversight and insights:  A univied view that elimiates the to switch between different cloud services dashboards.
    - Logs and metrics in context: With a single click, the dashboard shows an analysis of logs and metrics for a selected resource in its appropriate context, making it easier to understand the complexities inherent in cloud infrastructure.
    - Enhanced troubleshooting: Troubleshooting is more effective when teams can see patterns and anomalies across all cloud environments, rather than analyzing them in isolation.

Check out this [blog](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/maximizing-the-potential-of-multicloud-strategy-with-the-dynatrace-cloud-app/) for additional use cases.  Also here's a link to the [docs](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/platform-modules/infrastructure-monitoring/cloud-platform-monitoring/clouds-app)

### Tasks to complete this step

1. In Dynatrace from menu on the left, select `Apps -> Clouds`.
1. Click on All Services and select the Azure VM called `dt-orders-monolith` to view the metrics for that VM
    ![image](img/lab3-cloudapps-allservices.png)
    - Click on Metrics, and Logs tab  to quickly access the details for that service.
    - Also, if there'an open problem against this host, you can quickly view the problem details on `Problems` tab.
1. Select another service such as the `Kubernetes` Azure Load Balancer service
    - Notice all the properties we bring in for this service including the Azure tags
        ![image](img/lab3-cloudapps-k8.png)
1. Notice all of the other ways you can filter the cloud services by service type, regions, or service names, clouds, etc to look for details on specific metric.

## Custom Metric Event Setup
Duration: 3

Dynatrace Davis automatically analyzes abnormal situations within your IT infrastructure and attempts to identify any relevant impact and root cause. Davis relies on a wide spectrum of information sources, such as a transactional view of your services and applications, as well as on events raised on individual nodes within your Smartscape topology.

There are two main sources for single events in Dynatrace:

* Metric-based events (events that are triggered by a series of measurements) and
events that are independent of any metric (for example, process crashes, deployment changes, and VM motion events)
* Custom metric events are configured in the global settings of your environment and are visible to all Dynatrace users in your environment.

### Tasks to complete this step
1. Setup Custom Metric Events for Alerting
    * To add custom alerts, navigate to `Settings --> Anomaly Detection --> Metric Events` menu. 
    * Click the `Add metric Event` button.
            ![image](img/lab4-alert-create-upd.png)
    * Fill in the below information on the `Add metric event` template
        1.  Summary:  `CPU % percentage`
        2.  Type:  `Metric key` from dropdown
        3.  Metric key `Azure CPU usage` from dropdown
            ![image](img/lab4-vm-alert-upd.png)
            <aside class="positive"> üí°There are similar CPU percentage metrics, please make sure you select the right one </aside>
        4.  Agregation `Average` from dropdown
        5.  Management zone `dt-orders-monolith`
        6.  under `Entities` click on `>` to see `Advanced dimension definition` and select `Azure VM` from dropdown
